The release date given at EECI2010 was &#8220;Soon&#8221; and today we&#8217;re updating the release date to &#8220;Near.&#8221; </p>

<p>The end of beta will mean some important changes at ExpressionEngine.com and we want to give the Community sufficient time to prepare. Here is what you need to know.</p>

<p>When ExpressionEngine 2.1 is released, <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">ExpressionEngine 1.x will no longer be available for purchase</span>. EE 1.x will officially become a legacy version. We promised that we would keep the transition from EE 1.x to EE 2.x as natural as possible and not force it unnecessarily. Given that commitment, here is what you can expect:</p>

<ul class="blogLists">
<li>If you own an EE 1.x license you will have continued download access to EE 1.×.</li>
<li>New EE 2.1 purchases will also have access to EE 1.×. You will still be able to start with EE 1.x and migrate to 2.x at your convenience just like you can now with the EE 2 beta. <em>We will offer this through Dec. 31st, 2010</em>. After that, EE 1.x will not be available with new purchases but will continue to be available for download if you own a license.</li>
<li>When EE 2.1 launches, EE 1.x will be available as a separate download link instead of packaged with the EE 2 download like it currently is.</li>
<li>We will continue to provide technical support for EE 1.x as long as there is sufficient demand for it. Realistically we expect this to be throughout 2010 and a good deal into 2011 at the least.</li>
<li>EllisLab will provide six months notice prior to discontinuing EE 1.x support.</li>
<li>When EE 2.1 launches EllisLab will continue to provide security updates for EE 1.x in our usual speedy and thorough fashion.</li>
<li>EllisLab will continue to provide bug fixes for EE 1.x, though this will be at a reduced rate as development priority will be firmly on EE 2.×.</li>
</ul>

<p>Coinciding with EE 2.1’s release, ExpressionEngine.com will be undergoing a refresh that includes replacing EE 1.x documentation and support resources with resources focused on EE 2. We will do our best to keep current URLs intact or redirected. If something breaks we&#8217;ll do our best to restore it quickly. </p>

<p>If there is something you absolutely reference everyday other than the EE 1.x User Guide, please make a copy for yourself and let us know about it in the <a href="http://expressionengine.com/forums/viewthread/158396/">Discussion Thread for this post</a>. We will do our best to notify the Community prior to any major resource change that can’t be redirected in a seamless manner.</p>

<p>Please keep in mind this is a fairly significant update to a lot of resources and we appreciate your patience, help, and feedback during the process. Right now the main thing you can do to help is tell other EE people who may not read the blog or stay updated on EllisLab news. When we say sufficient time, we mean it, so this isn&#8217;t happening immediately but don&#8217;t procrastinate because it will be happening in the near future. </p>

<p>I will be happy to answer any questions posted to the <a href="http://expressionengine.com/forums/viewthread/158396/">Discussion Thread</a>. See you on the boards!</p>

<p>Ryan Masuga has also built a reputation for being an outspoken critic of well, everything, on his Twitter account, <a href="http://twitter.com/masuga">@masuga</a> that keeps everyone, including us here at EllisLab, on our toes. </p>

<p>Between the two Ryans you can stay on top of 99.9% of everything happening in the ExpressionEngine Community. </p>

<p>At EllisLab we are doing our part to support both their efforts. We love what they do and how they impact the lives of web professionals. </p>

<p>No matter how comprehensive your web toolkit is clients will find a way to deliver a new challenge.

But time is a precious thing, a commodity that always seems in short supply. </p>

<p>Now imagine a building packed with web professionals who bring with them an amazing array of skill sets and thousands and thousands of hours of collective experience. What if this building had an exclusive space with food, coffee, net access, work stations, all setup in way to encourage people to help each other solve complex issues quickly. </p>

<p>Do you make some or all of your living deploying ExpressionEngine and/or CodeIgniter? Do you want an opportunity that has an unbelievably high return on investment for your time and money? Then please carefully consider this list of <a href="http://eeci2010.com/speakers/">EECI2010 speakers</a>:</strong> </p>

<ul class="blogLists">
<li><strong>Rick Ellis:</strong> Wrote pMachine, ExpressionEngine, and CodeIgniter. EECI is a rare opportunity to meet one of the people who shaped blogging and web publishing from the beginning.</li>
<li><strong>Leslie Camacho:</strong> I&#8217;ve helped thousands of web professionals succeed for over a decade and I&#8217;ve had the privelidge of building one of the most influential web publishing software companies.</li>
<li><strong>Derek Jones:</strong> The current mastermind behind most of ExpressionEngine and CodeIgniter&#8217;s on going development with years of experience deploying code to thousands of users.</li>
<li><strong>Derek Allard:</strong> Creative specialist with years of experience translating community feedback into an improved software platform. Plus, he&#8217;s the&#8230; actually, can&#8217;t talk about that yet.</li>
<li><strong>Simon Collison:</strong> The mighty Simon Collison, known best as Colly, has been an EE evangelist almost from day one. Colly was the first to write in-depth EE tutorials in a book from a major publisher but is best known for being a design super star. He was one the brains behind the ExpressionEngine 2.0 Example Site that helps people learn EE from the HTML/CSS all the way through final implementation. He gave one of the best presentations at EECI2009 and I&#8217;m personally looking forward to what he does at EECI2010.</li>
<li><strong>Adii Rockstar:</strong> One of the masterminds behind <a href="http://woothemes.com">WooThemes</a>, one of the most successful and influential theme communities.</li>
<li><strong>Thomas Myer:</strong> Author of one of the first CodeIgniter books with years of experience developing and deploying web applications to clients.</li>
<li><strong>Ryan Irelan:</strong> There are a handful of people in the EE Community that EllisLab considers &#8220;Community Avatars&#8221; because they embody in a single person what the EE Community is all about. By day he works for Happy Cog, by night he&#8217;s the Community Super Hero who has single handedly empowered thousands of developers to be more successful.</li>

EllisLab Partnership Opportunities";s:4:"link";s:57:"http://expressionengine.com/blog/entry/eeci2010_topten_8/";s:2:"dc";a:1:{s:7:"creator";s:14:"Leslie Camacho";}s:8:"category";s:15:"NewsThe Insider";s:8:"comments";s:57:"http://expressionengine.com/blog/entry/eeci2010_topten_8/";s:11:"description";s:4591:"<p><a href="http://expressionengine.com/blog/entry/eeci2010_top_ten/">Top Ten Reasons Why EECI is the Event of the Year</a>. <a href="http://eeci2010.com">Register now!</a></p>

<p>We&#8217;ve given ourselves the mandate that 2010 is the Year of the Community. We&#8217;ve been quietly building relationships and investing in Community led resources to help ensure that they remain alive and viable for a long time. </p>

<p>For example, EllisLab and <a href="http://enginehosting.com">EngineHosting</a> have been working with Ryan Masuga at <a href="http://devot-ee.com">Devot:ee</a> to make Devot:ee the official go-to place for 3rd party add-on info. EngineHosting has donated hosting services and EllisLab&#8217;s Greg Aker has lent his expertise to Ryan as needed. </p>

<p>We&#8217;ve been working with Marcus Neto and Jeff Claeson on <a href="http://show-ee.com">Show-ee</a>. The initial response from the soft launch has been fantastic. Our goal is to make Show-ee the official Community Showcase and change the way we do the Showcase at ExpressionEngine.com. We&#8217;re not there yet, but that&#8217;s our shared goal, to provide a platform that lets the Community&#8217;s EE work stand proud in the way it deserves. We&#8217;re looking forward to seeing where Marcus and Jeff take it. </p>

<p>We&#8217;re working with EE Community veteran Ryan Irelan over at <a href="http://eeinsider.com">EE Insider</a> to find better ways to promote Community news and resources. I can&#8217;t say what the specifics of that are just yet, but you&#8217;ll likely find out at EECI2010. </p>

<p>Then there is our work with Mike Boyink over at <a href="http://train-ee.com">Train-ee</a> to research different options for EE certification and better professional training resources. Mike has done an incredible job of talking with people and providing detailed feedback and suggestions. </p>

<p>Our goal is to provide tangible benefits and resources to each project that help them succeed while allowing them to retain independence from EllisLab. In short, we want to help them do what they do best without influencing the content or substance of what they do. Their independence is what makes them shine. </p>

<p>We&#8217;re working on a few more that aren&#8217;t quite far enough along to talk about just yet but we&#8217;re getting to them as fast as we possibly can. And, of course, we have several great proposals from people we highly respect that we&#8217;re looking forward to investigating. </p>

<p>If you&#8217;ve made it this far into the post there is a good chance that you have an opportunity you want to discuss with EllisLab. We literally get 100s of pitches over the course of a year and 99% of them never happen. The ones that do all have one thing in common. We&#8217;ve met the people involved and they&#8217;ve taken the time to get to know us. </p>

<p><a href="http://eeci2010.com">EECI2010</a> is the best opportunity you will have all year to meet us and share your idea with us. Its your chance to shake our hands, sit down, and find out if an idea has life or not. </p>

<p>The examples above are just that, examples. If you have an idea, we&#8217;re interested in hearing you out. Or perhaps you don&#8217;t have a specific idea but just a general sense that you and EllisLab should be working together. Maybe you&#8217;re an EllisLab customer that just wants the ear of the President for awhile. That&#8217;s perfectly fine too. If you have a passion for seeing the Pro Net reworked, I&#8217;d love to meet with you about that (we&#8217;ve been quietly looking for a Pro Net Champ to help implement a much needed Pro Net refresh). </p>

<p>I&#8217;m making myself available for private and small group meetings (as appropriate) throughout EECI to as many EE &amp; CI entrepreneurs as possible. This opportunity is restricted to EECI2010 ticket holders. We&#8217;re most interested in working with those who show up, see the Community in person, and invest in its future success. </p>

<p>To setup an appointment just . I&#8217;d love to hear from you and setup the appointment in advance. Your email should include your full name and a brief summary of what you&#8217;d like our meeting to accomplish. I will accommodate as many requests as humanly possible.</p>

<p>The meetings will not be on a first come, first serve basis. Preference will be given to Pro Net members and people who are actively involved in the EE Community in some way. If that doesn&#8217;t describe you, email me anyway! Its not meant to be a discouragement. </p>

<p>See you at EECI!

<p>Here we see a classic EECI moment. Pictured above is  Leevi Graham, the guy known for writing EE add-ons in his sleep, demoing a new EE module to EllisLab Technology Architect Derek Allard. </p>

<p>There were literally hundreds of such conversations that took place between EllisLab and you, the people. Each conversation was cataloged in a notebook. In fact, it was common to see someone from EllisLab with notebook and pen in hand taking scrupulous notes during or shortly after a conversation. </p>

<p>Allard and I would meet back at the hotel or over food and drinks and share them back and forth. And when we needed clarity on specifics, we just found the people the next morning and asked. </p>

<p>When EECI2009 concluded our collective notebooks traveled back across the ocean, were transcribed into digital form, and shared with the entire EllisLab team. </p>

<p>We estimate that 70% of all EE &amp; CI development is driven by user feedback. We&#8217;re proud of how we consistently review feedback on the Feature Request forum, the Community Forums in general, and email. Our internal listening system works quite well and ensures that the community has a significant voice in our software&#8217;s development and direction. </p>

<p>But there is absolutely no doubt that these face to face conversations influence ExpressionEngine &amp; CodeIgniter&#8217;s development more so than any other method. Sharing client war stories, implementation successes and failures, frustrations, victories, and ultimately understanding each other&#8217;s professional stories in person creates the best software. There is no digital intermediary to potentially muddy communication. </p>

<p>There are numerous features, fixes, and implementation strategies in EE 2 and CI that we can trace directly back to conversations at EECI2009.</p>

<p>EECI2010 will feature the CodeShare Corner (sponsored by <a href="http://solspace.com">Solspace</a>), a space dedicated to sharing stories and ideas, coffee, snacks, and a calm environment to recharge yourself and your gear. If you&#8217;ve ever met Mitchell and the incredible EE add-on dev team at Solspace, then you know he is the perfect person to host such a gathering. </p>

<p>Its very likely you&#8217;ll find someone from EllisLab at the CodeShare Corner throughout <a href="http://eeci2010.com">EECI2010</a>. Come find us. We&#8217;re looking forward to shaking your hand and hearing your story. See you at EECI2010.

Sharing client war stories, implementation successes and failures, frustrations, victories, and ultimately understanding each other&#8217;s professional stories in person creates the best software. There is no digital intermediary to potentially muddy communication. </p>

<p>There are numerous features, fixes, and implementation strategies in EE 2 and CI that we can trace directly back to conversations at EECI2009.</p>

<p>EECI2010 will feature the CodeShare Corner (sponsored by <a href="http://solspace.com">Solspace</a>), a space dedicated to sharing stories and ideas, coffee, snacks, and a calm environment to recharge yourself and your gear. If you&#8217;ve ever met Mitchell and the incredible EE add-on dev team at Solspace, then you know he is the perfect person to host such a gathering. </p>

<p>Its very likely you&#8217;ll find someone from EllisLab at the CodeShare Corner throughout <a href="http://eeci2010.com">EECI2010</a>. Come find us. We&#8217;re looking forward to shaking your hand and hearing your story. See you at EECI2010.

<p>EECI2009 was so incredible that it convinced us to gather our team from around the globe and meet all of you at EECI2010. At EECI2010 you&#8217;ll meet&#8230;</p>

<p>The Super Hero Front Line, otherwise known as our Technical Support Specialist team: </p>

<ul class="blogLists">
<li>Sue Crocker</li>
<li>John Donovan</li>
<li>Greg Salt</li>
<li>Brandon Jones</li>
</ul>

<p>You&#8217;ll meet their fearless leader Lisa Wess, our Director of Community Services (rumor has it she is the real power behind all of EllisLab). </p>

<p>The ExpressionEngine and CodeIgniter Code Heroes that make up the Development Team:</p>

<ul class="blogLists">
<li>Derek Allard</li>
<li>Robin Sowell</li>
<li>Greg Aker</li>
<li>Pascal Kriete</li>
</ul><p>
The Dev Team is led by our intrepid CTO, Derek Jones. </p>

<p>You&#8217;ll also meet me, the President of EllisLab though I&#8217;m better known as &#8220;that guy who brings the coffee and keeps things running.&#8221; </p>

<p>Plus <a href="http://enginehosting.com">EngineHosting</a> CTO Nevin Lyne will be there along with Senior Manager Laurie Ruggles. If you weren&#8217;t already aware, Nevin is to servers as Joe Satriani is to guitars. Yes, he&#8217;s that good. Just strike up a conversation about anything hosting related and see for yourself. If you were at the last big EllisLab SXSW party at the Moonshine then you saw Laurie&#8217;s work first hand, as she headed up the team that decked out the Moonshine in spectacular fashion that evening. </p>

<p>And finally, EECI2009 was an event of such impressive magnitude that it lured our founder out of hiding. Yes, Rick Ellis the Owner and Chief Entrepreneur of EllisLab will be attending EECI2010. Rumors that Rick Ellis will be participating in the Keynote to bring you up to speed on EE, CI, and the future of EllisLab are completely true. </p>

<p>We hope you all come and join us. We love meeting people. We make ExpressionEngine and CodeIgniter for you. We want it to make your lives better and help you build great things. We take our job of <em>saving the Internet one site at a time</em> seriously and this is our collective chance to come together and work toward that goal in person. See you in May!

<p>Active development on ExpressionEngine 1.x has indeed ceased, but support and bug fixes will continue for some time.&nbsp; A particular bug fix relating to the Pages module required a database change, which necessitates a version update rather than only replacing files.</p>

<p>As a result, it is imperative with this release that if you are running any add-ons that utilize the Pages module, or are interacting with the &#8216;site_pages&#8217; array directly via PHP in your templates, you will need to update the add-ons or code per the version update notes: <a href="http://expressionengine.com/docs/installation/version_notes_1.6.9.html">1.6.9 notes</a> and <a href="http://expressionengine.com/public_beta/docs/installation/version_notes_2.0.2.html">2.0.2 notes</a>.&nbsp; Not updating these add-ons or code simultaneous to performing the ExpressionEngine update may result in broken pages. Add-ons that may be affected include Structure, LG Better Meta, and the Nested Menu Plugin.&nbsp; Developers of these add-ons were given pre-release code to have opportunity to update their public releases.&nbsp; Please check for modified versions before updating.</p>

<p>The development team considers this a big milestone for the 2.0 Public Beta, having fixed 130 bugs, restored some extension hooks, and bringing the application closer to our goals for 2.1.</p>

<p>Since we required a database update to 1.x, we did happen to sneak in one feature into 1.6.9 that was suggested to us by Jim at <a href="http://transmodern.net/">Transmodern Media</a>, an enhancement to ExpressionEngine&#8217;s Password Lockout feature.&nbsp; The feature now has additional protection against brute force attacks, an extremely rare event that would often be protected already by use of the Throttling feature, but nonetheless, this feature has been modified to help prevent &#8220;smart&#8221; brute force crackers from trying to play the system, improving the security of accounts on your installation that may be using weak passwords.

<p>This year for much of the weekend we put our schedules into your hands, went where you wanted, and engaged in conversations that were important to you.&nbsp; Between the UserVoice sessions and the meals we hosted, this year seemed to afford more opportunities for in depth conversations with users and developers on how EllisLab can help them to succeed in their businesses.</p>

<p>The diversity was amazing, ranging from people new to ExpressionEngine sharing a table with vets and professional developers, all the way to educators using CodeIgniter in their curriculum.&nbsp; The wide range of interest that SXSW attracts undoubtedly brings together the full spectrum of our users to the same place, and it was a blast.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.austinducks.com/">Austin Duck Adventure</a> was a perfect respite, escaping the downtown area out to Lake Austin, where the amphibous bus carrying our 20 guests promptly drove into the water and cruised around in beautiful weather.</p>

<p>Our UserVoice panels packed out the Executive Lounge in the Hilton, and the topics you chose (&#8220;Module Building from the Experts&#8221; and &#8220;CodeIgniter Web Apps with ExpressionEngine&#8221;) certainly kept us on our toes.&nbsp; For those who weren&#8217;t able to attend, there were two big takeaways from these discussions.</p>

<p>The first is that a key ingredient to a successful add-on is the amount of time and thought put into deciding what type of add-on the feature you&#8217;re building is best suited for.&nbsp; Much of that discussion focused on the new add-on type, Accessories, as they give both novices and expert developers alike nearly unlimited power to add persistent information to the ExpressionEngine control panel without any hacks or worrying with Extensions.</p>

<p>The second was a discussion about how a CodeIgniter application can benefit from running alongside or from within ExpressionEngine.&nbsp; Some applications are suited to run outside of the ExpressionEngine instance (a request heavy application that doesn&#8217;t need all of ExpressionEngine&#8217;s abilities for instance) and others are well suited to make extremely minor additions to allow them to run as fully built ExpressionEngine add-ons.&nbsp; Attendees were spitballing integration ideas, culminating in a long pause followed by a &#8220;wow, you&#8217;re blowing my mind&#8221; from one guest.</p>

<p>The highlight for us personally had to be Monday&#8217;s &#8220;ExpressionEngine 2.0: Total Domination&#8221; panel, with <a href="http://www.happycog.com/">Happy Cog</a> speakers Ryan Irelan, Jenn Lukas, Brian Warren, and Mark Huot, moderated by Kenny Meyers.&nbsp; This crew did such a fabulous job (neither authored nor even sponsored by EllisLab, incidentally) that SXSW staff were commenting about how it was the best panel they had seen all weekend.&nbsp; <a href="http://eeinsider.com/blog/sxsw-expressionengine-panel-slides/">The slides</a> will give you a summary of the content, but they can&#8217;t capture just how well each speaker brought their topics to life.</p>

<p>Kenny introduced the audience to ExpressionEngine, with user quotes from Obama and Zeus.&nbsp; He then introduced Ryan Irelan who showed how easy it is to use ExpressionEngine to build sites from any source of content, showcasing a racing client who used Twitter, Twitpics, and Twitvids to publish and share their media.&nbsp; ExpressionEngine was employed in a way that used entries to control the featured content of the site, aggregating this rich content from external services that the race team used through the day of a race.</p>

<p>Jenn Lukas&#8217;s philosophy is that every site is different, but they&#8217;re also all a little bit the same.&nbsp; She really went the extra mile and launched a new site: <a href="http://starterfiles.com/">ExpressionEngine Starter Files</a>, a robust set of files meant to drop in place in an ExpressionEngine 2.0 installation as a starting point for the creation of any ExpressionEngine powered site.</p>

<p>Brian Warren delved into the power of Accessories (the ExpressionEngine buzz word this year, it seems), showing how to harness their power to benefit your sites and your clients.&nbsp; Two featured Accessories were Derek Hogue&#8217;s beautiful <a href="http://devot-ee.com/add-ons/accessories/cp-analytics/">Google Analytics accessory</a> and Newism&#8217;s <a href="http://github.com/newism/nsm.addon_updater.ee_addon">Addon Updater</a>.</p>

<p>Veteran developer Mark Huot talked about the Channel API: ExpressionEngine 2.0&#8217;s methods for interacting with your entries and Channel related metadata.&nbsp; Especially considering that this API is not yet fully documented for third party developers, Mark did a fantastic job of showcasing how much time and coding energy the new APIs can save.&nbsp; It was great to see some of these fundamental changes made in ExpressionEngine 2.0&#8217;s underlying architecture already benefitting developers, even while still in public beta.</p>

<p>They ended with a Q&amp;A session, and we were practically blushing when someone who was completely new to ExpressionEngine asked on mic if the community was any good and the audience spontaneously erupted in a rowdy affirmative.&nbsp; You guys rock.</p>

<p>That night, Robert Earhart of Whoooz! Media hosted the EECI preParty at The Library, generously providing pizza, drinks, and a space (complete with pool tables) for the community to hang out and chat about the <a href="http://eeci2010.com/">upcoming conference</a> in San Francisco.&nbsp; He also gave away three tickets to the May event, and we announced the random drawing winner of an EllisLab sponsored full conference pass: <a href="http://expressionengine.com/forums/member/35906/">Jesse Schutt</a>.&nbsp; Congratulations, Jesse!</p>

<p>If the audience gathered at the EECI preParty was any indication, this event is one that you do <em>not</em> want to miss.&nbsp; The opportunities for learning, sharing, and networking with fellow ExpressionEngine and CodeIgniter professionals is unparalleled.</p>

<p>SXSW 2010 was a wonderful event and this post only touches the tip of the iceberg.&nbsp; This year it really was all about you, and we could easily fill a book with the details of the conversations and connections made.&nbsp; A big thanks from all of us to those that were able to join us; we can&#8217;t wait until May to join up with you again and to meet those that couldn&#8217;t make it to SXSW!

<p>They ended with a Q&amp;A session, and we were practically blushing when someone who was completely new to ExpressionEngine asked on mic if the community was any good and the audience spontaneously erupted in a rowdy affirmative.&nbsp; You guys rock.</p>

<p>That night, Robert Earhart of Whoooz! Media hosted the EECI preParty at The Library, generously providing pizza, drinks, and a space (complete with pool tables) for the community to hang out and chat about the <a href="http://eeci2010.com/">upcoming conference</a> in San Francisco.&nbsp; He also gave away three tickets to the May event, and we announced the random drawing winner of an EllisLab sponsored full conference pass: <a href="http://expressionengine.com/forums/member/35906/">Jesse Schutt</a>.&nbsp; Congratulations, Jesse!</p>

<p>If the audience gathered at the EECI preParty was any indication, this event is one that you do <em>not</em> want to miss.&nbsp; The opportunities for learning, sharing, and networking with fellow ExpressionEngine and CodeIgniter professionals is unparalleled.</p>

<p>SXSW 2010 was a wonderful event and this post only touches the tip of the iceberg.&nbsp; This year it really was all about you, and we could easily fill a book with the details of the conversations and connections made.&nbsp; A big thanks from all of us to those that were able to join us; we can&#8217;t wait until May to join up with you again and to meet those that couldn&#8217;t make it to SXSW!
