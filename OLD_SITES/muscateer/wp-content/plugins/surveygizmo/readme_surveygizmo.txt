== Overview ==
The SurveyGizmo Plugin allows you interact with SurveyGizmo.com to run surveys, polls, contact forms,  newsletter signups, data collection, anything with a web form. Monitor survey stats from the comfort of your WP dashboard.

You can create custom survey templates similar to WordPress templates. You can also use SurveyGizmo to post data to other API's (SalesForce.com, Constant Contact, etc) through the HTTP Post question type, or send email auto-responders or email invites to survey goers.

There are just too many SurveyGizmo features to list here - go get a free account and check it out.

== Installation ==
1. Unzip the file and then upload the entire "surveygizmo" folder to wp-content/plugins directory. Make sure to add the whole folder, not the individual files.
2. Activate it in the Plugin options
3. Go to the Admin -> Options -> SurveyGizmo page to enter your SurveyGizmo User API Key. You can find the API key on your Account page (remember you can get an account free).

== Use == 
1. Click the Create Survey Button from the dashboard (this will take you to the surveybuilder)
2. Build your survey, add questions, customize your look and feel
3. Publish your survey - THIS IS AN IMPORTANT STEP TO ADD TO YOUR BLOG
4. On the dashboard click on the "Pub Links" for your survey to show the Survey Link and the JavaScript Embed Link
5. Cut & Paste one of the Publish Links and paste it into the HTML of your survey. IMPORTANT: you need to add it to the HTML. So if you have the Visual Rich Text Editor (the one that looks like MS Word and is turned on by default) then click on the HTML button in the editor toolbar and paste the link into there. NOTE: you wont be able to see the JS embedded survey in the editor but you will see it in the preview.
6. Your done!
